# Raylib C Template

### [tsoding/raylib-template](https://github.com/tsoding/raylib-template/) with my personal preference of additions

## Adaptive integer scaling

This template has an integer scaling system, like you'd see with emulators of low resolution systems.

## Compiling and running your game

Compile ```nob.c``` by running:

```console
$ cc -o nob nob.c
```

Then, run ```nob``` to compile ```main```:

```console
$ ./nob
```

Now, you can run your project with:

```console
$ ./main
```

## Congratulations!

You are now an independent game developer! 

I hope you make something great

Don't stay up too late!
